#### Q: Is there a channel with all of the community addons?
A: No, but most devs have their own servers;

- [AIT Extras](https://discord.gg/5JDKuzarcS)

- [AWT](https://discord.gg/pR4H948328)

#### Q: How do I make a mod addon?
A: If you want to make a mod addon, refer to [this article](../development/).

#### Q: How do I make a datapack addon?
A: If you want to make a datapack addon, refer to [this article](../datapacks/).

#### Q: What do I choose: datapack or mod for making an addon for AIT?
A: Depends. If you just want to add interiors, desktops, exterior and console variants, custom tardis names and etc then you're free to choose "datapack" as your option.
Otherwise, making a mod is recommended. And yes, you can use a datapack inside a mod.

#### Q: I changed my interior and now I can't turn the power on!
A: You need to set up the [engine](../blocks/engine).

#### Q: Windows don't glow! (without Iris)
A: Make sure you have power on. If you use Iris or any of its derivatives then make sure you're using 1.0.5+ of AIT, or 1.0.6+ if you're on Forge.

#### Q: The toyota console is all black!
A: Make sure you have power on. If you use Iris or any of its derivatives then make sure you're using 1.0.5+ of AIT, or 1.0.6+ if you're on Forge.

#### Q: What mods are incompatible with AIT?
A: Bellow is the ones we currently know about, if you know of any not listed here please feel free to inform us!

| Immersive Portals : Stops people from being able to enter / exit the tardis. |

| No Nametag Render : Will stop the control names from showing (no ones fault, it's the mod doing its job). |

| Concurrent Chunk Management Engine : Seems to break rift chunks and tardis growth. |

#### Q: The rendering is buggy with shaders!
