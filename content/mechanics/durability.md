## WHY MUST YOU DO THIS TO US?
Yes yes i get it durability might seem scary at first but fear not as our durability isn't a major pain.

* Each Subsystem/circuit (including the engine) has a max durability of 1250.

* To increase durability simply right click the subsystem/circuit (with the listed items at the bottom of the page), this increases the durability by 5.

* Not all subsystems/circuits have durability.

* Subsystems/circuits do not break when they get to 0 durability,they just stop working till you repair them.

* The only exeption for this is the demat circuit which can break due to engine phasing.

## What if i run out of durability?

Depends,circuits/subsystems wont break if you run out of it but they'll malfunction, as an example.

* Chameleon circuit will randomize instead of selecting the designated exterior.

* Demat circuit can engine phase if under 300 durability.

## How do i see durability?
  Sonic in scanning mode.

## How does durability go down?

* For the engine durability slowly goes passivly down over time.

* For the other circuits/subsystems that have durability, they'll go down if the system they power is used (example if you fly with the demat circuit the demat circuits durability goes down).

## How do i increase / fix low durability systems?

 You can `right click ` on the block with low durability using; iron, copper, and gold to increase the durability / repair it.
