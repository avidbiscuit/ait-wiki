title: Control Durability

## How Does it Work?
During unstabilized flight, controls will break down over time. You have to either, use a mallet (the hammer) on them to bypass any breakage, or use a sonic screwdriver in TARDIS mode to repair the control.

## How Will I Know What State It's In?
Pretty much if it's not smoking, it's fine. If it's smoking of ANY KIND, on fire, sparking, etc., it needs repair.

## Different States of Durability
1. FULL - Max durability, normal controls
2. OCCASIONALLY_JAM - Occasionally jams
3. SPARKING - Sparks, won't let you use it occasionally
4. CATCH_FIRE - Catches fire, won't let you use it occasionally
5. JAMMED - Won't let you use it

## How To Fix
To fix, use a Sonic Screwdriver in TARDIS Mode on any broken control to fix it fully, but, if you just need to use that control quick, you can use the Mallet (hammer) and force the control to execute its part of the flight event.
