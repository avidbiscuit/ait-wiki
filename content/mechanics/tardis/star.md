## What does it do?
Floats far below the TARDIS interior and spins at a slow pace. When **The TARDIS** is refueling the Eye of Harmony's Rays begin pulsing.<br> 
<br>If a player drops items into the Eye of Harmony, they will be deposited back at the main door of the TARDIS<br>
<br>If a player falls into the Eye of Harmony, they will be deposited back at the main door of the TARDIS<br>
<br>
**NOTE: THE EYE OF HARMONY GOES SUPER-NOVA DURING SECURITY PROTOCOL 000 (Self-Destruct). ALL ITEMS LEFT INSIDE THE INTERIOR OF THE TARDIS WILL BE DESTROYED**
