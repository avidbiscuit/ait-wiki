## How do i start flying around?

* Make sure you have enough power for your trip
* Disable the handbrake if it's active
* Pull the throttle up to any level you wish and take off
* When you reach your destination push the throttle back down
* However, during flights you'll have to do "flight event" **unless you have Protocol 116 enabled**

## I have dementia what do I do?

* Fear not, simply put the sonic in scanning mode and into the sonic port on the console, now you'll be told what to press to complete a flight event.

## Turns out I actually suck at flying the TARDIS even WITH the warnings, what do I do?

* Auto pilot is something you can use to turn off flight events, however it caps your speed low and you won't be able to gain loyalty.
